# v0.11.5 Release Notes

This release makes the link checker more robust when the initial "HEAD" request fails. Previously it would retry using the GET method on some errors; now it retries any failure.

# v0.11.4 Release Notes

This release fixes a bug in the link checker in v0.11.3 that caused it to incorrectly report directories as broken links instead of checking them.

# v0.11.3 Release Notes

This release fixes a bug in the link checker that caused it to fail with `IsADirectoryError` when attempting to check a link that omits the trailing the `/` from a directory index.

Additionally, this release contains minor adjustments to the default stylesheet and templates, and adds the template information from the v0.11.0 release notes to a README in the templates directory.

# v0.11.2 Release Notes

This release fixes a bug where the link checker ignored "known broken links" when checking links with absolute paths. (Prior to v0.11.0, the link checker wasn't capable of checking these links at all, so it skipped them regardless of whether they were marked as known broken links.)

# v0.11.1 Release Notes

This release introduces a simple HTTP server to aid development of sites that use absolute paths in links, and to work around some issues with absolute paths in PDF generation.

- **Watch mode** (`--watch` or just `-w`) now starts a simple HTTP server at `http://localhost:32289/` by default. You can use this to test your site locally if it uses absolute links.
- **PDF mode** now uses an HTTP server, by default, to pass the pages to Prince. This works around problems with Prince being unable to resolve absolute hyperlinks from one page to another page in the PDF.

When using either (or both) of the above options, you can specify a different port to use with the `--http_port` commandline option. To disable the HTTP server, specify `--http_port 0`.

# v0.11.0 Release Notes

This release brings new template functionality and improvements to the link checker.

## New Features

- New, more powerful built-in templates.
- You can now include or extend built-in templates.
- The link checker supports absolute paths.
- External Links filter.
- Various fixes and minor improvements, especially for handling absolute paths (sites with subdirectories or "pretty URLs").

For details, keep reading.

### Template Improvements

Dactyl has a new and improved set of built-in HTML templates, and now supports including or extending the built-in templates. These templates contain a bunch of useful stuff in modular format, so you can pull in what you need, replace what you don't, and get updates automatically when Dactyl is updated.

Many of the templates work better if you set certain fields on your target or page definitions. Here's a list of those fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `prefix` | The base path for this site. Use `/` for a site served from the top-level of its domain. Required for navigation if your site has subfolders or "pretty URLs". |
| `logo` | URL or path for a logo image to use in the top-left. If not defined, uses a text header instead. |
| `google_analytics_tag` | String tag to use with Google Analytics, e.g. "UA-00000000-0". If not defined, doesn't load Google Analytics. |
| `repository` | URL to this site's source repository on GitHub. Required for the "Edit on GitHub" button. |
| `url` | The fully-qualified URL for the base of the site. Required by the sitemap and Google Search templates. |
| `stylesheet` | URL or path to the default stylesheet. The default includes Bootstrap 4.5 as well as custom CSS for code tabs, callouts, and the page layout. See the [styles dir](./dactyl/styles/) for the source SCSS. The default is served by dactyl.link. |
| `dactyljs` | URL or path to the Dactyl JavaScript file to use. This defines "jump to top" and code tab behavior. The default is served by dactyl.link. |
| `bootstrapjs` | URL or path to the Bootstrap JavaScript file to use. The default is served by BootstrapCDN. |
| `fontawesomecss` | URL or path to FontAwesome (v4) CSS file to use. The default is served by BootstrapCDN. |


#### Page Templates

The following built-in templates represent **full pages**, so you can use them with the `default_template:` and `template:` settings in the config file or frontmatter. You can also derive your own templates from these templates using `{% extends 'template' %}` syntax.

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| `404.html` | Contains an error message intended to be used as a custom 404 page. |
| `base.html` | A general purpose template with a 3-column layout, fixed header, and a footer. The navigation uses the hierarchy (`parent` and `child`) fields introduced by Dactyl v0.10.0. This uses [Bootstrap 4.5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/). Most of the other built-in templates are derived from this template. |
| `doc.html` | Specialized for individual documents. This is the new default template. The right sidebar has an in-page table of contents, and this runs code tab and syntax highlighting JavaScript by default. (You still need to enable the multicode_tabs filter in your `dactyl-config.yml` file to get code tab syntax.) |
| `landing.html` | A landing page that displays a list of child pages in the center column. |
| `pdf-cover.html` | A cover page and table of contents for PDFs. |
| `redirect.html` | Redirects the user to another URL, as set by the page's `redirect_url` field. Useful for deprecating pages. |
| `simple.html` | A minimal template with no dependencies. |
| `template-sitemap.txt` | A template for a text [sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en) for use by search engines. |

When extending the default templates, you many of them have blocks you can replace. For the full list, see [the templates](./dactyl/templates/) directly.


#### Module Templates

The following built-in templates are partial modules you can use with `{% include 'templatehere.html' %}` blocks from other templates. Many of these pieces are used by the page templates above, as well:

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| `algolia-docsearch.html` | Provides a search box (and accompanying resources) powered by [Algolia DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/). To use this, you must provide your Algolia API key in the target's `algolia_api_key` field provide your index name in the target's `algolia_index_name` field. |
| `breadcrumbs.html` | Provides [breadcrumbs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/breadcrumb/) to the current page, based on the hierarchy fields. |
| `children.html` | Displays a bulleted list of children of the current page. You can modify the behavior by setting certain properties before including this template. (See below for an example.) |
| `footer.html` | A footer containing a copyright notice, license link, and language selector (if you have the right fields defined). |
| `github-edit.html` | A button that links to edit the current page's source file on GitHub. Requires the target's `repository` field to be the URL of the site's repository on GitHub. |
| `header.html` | A fixed header containing a logo, navigation to top-level pages, search, and Edit on GitHub buttons if the right fields are defined. |
| `language-dropdown.html` | A language-selector dropdown that points to the equivalent page in other languages, if you have multiple languages defined. (This is the one used in the header.) |
| `language-dropdown.html` | A horizontal language selector that points to the equivalent page in other languages, if you have multiple languages defined. (This is the one used in the footer.) |
| `page-toc.html` | A Bootstrap/ScrollSpy-ready table of contents based on the headers in the current page's Markdown contents. |
| `tree-nav.html` | Tree-style site navigation with collapsible levels. You can set a custom page to be the "top" of the tree to show only a subset of your site. Otherwise it uses the first page (usually the auto-provided cover page) as the top of the tree. Set `nav_omit: true` on a page to hide that page from this navigation. |

##### Children Module

The following demonstrates how to use the `children.html` template to display a list of children of a page (including links):

```html
{% set parent_html = 'some-parent.html' %}
{% set show_blurbs = True %}
{% set depth = 3 %}
{% include 'children.html' %}
```

You can omit any or all of the `{% set ... %}` statements to use the defaults:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `parent_html` | Which page's children to show. The HTML filename of that page. | The current page. |
| `show_blurbs` | If True, add the child page's `blurb` attribute next to its link. | False |
| `depth` | How many levels in the hierarchy to show below the parent. | 5 |

##### Tree Nav Module

The following shows how to display a subset of the tree nav (starting with the file `some_parent.html`) instead of the full tree:

```html
{% set tree_top = pages|selectattr('html', 'defined_and_equalto', 'some_parent.html')|list|first %}
{% include 'tree-nav.html' %}
```


### Link Checker

The link checker is now capable of handling absolute paths in the output. By default, it assumes the out directory is the top level of your site. If not, you can supply a commandline argument such as `--prefix /mysite/` to provide the folder

The link checker can now check a folder other than the default out path as specified in the config. Pass `-d some/nondefault/path/` to check another path.

### External Links Filter

The `external_links` filter is now part of mainline Dactyl. This filter finds `http://` and `https://` links (in other words, links to other sites) and marks them as external links by adding an icon to the end of the link text. It also makes those links open in a new tab/window by default.


## Bug Fixes and Other Improvements

- Fixed some issues in building PDFs with links and images that use absolute paths.
- Fixed a bug where cover pages wouldn't inherit fields from the target definition.
- Fixed a bug that caused log messages to be duplicated. Also downgrades some log messages to debug-level.
- Templates no longer raise an "Undefined" error when referencing undefined attributes of an object (e.g. target fields). (Only applies when not using strict undefined.)
- Refactored link checker somewhat to reduce technical debt.
